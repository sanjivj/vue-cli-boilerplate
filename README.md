# vue-cli-setup
vue-cli makes setting up a vue project super-easy, but why not take the
automation further? The lazyVue shell script starts with vue-cli, does the
project npm install, does basic git setup and runs the project.

Used exactly as vue-cli: 
  lazyVue.sh &lt;template> &lt;project-name>.
